title: Component Architecture and Music

Over the past few years, the idea of reusable components in web development has taken over the way websites are built, and for good reasons. Instead of having to rewrite code over and over for the same thing because it's in different places, we can now effectively write it once and then access it from wherever.

As a musician with a some background in electronic music, I can't help but see the striking similarity between this method of component architecture, and the way music is often created these days with something like Ableton Live, for example. In Ableton, I can create a "clip", a little piece of audio that is reusable, and I can essentially plug in wherever I want. Even better if it's a MIDI clip. At that point, the structure of what I need is there, yet I can swap out the internal components to customize the clip for its specific use case and it will still make sense in the context of the whole framework.

So it is with compoenents in web devleopment. Once I've designed a structure for something, I can save it and apply it to whatever aspect of the page I'd like. And better still, if it is a truly dynamic component where nothing is hard-coded and I can pass props and access state from a central store, the options are endless as I'm then able to apply customizations base on specific requirements while still having the benefit of highly reusable code.
