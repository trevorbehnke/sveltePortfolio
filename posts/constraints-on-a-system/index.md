title: Constraints on a system

I often think about the similarities between programming and real life. Specifically the idea of how placing constraints on a system is exactly what facilitates the ability to acheieve a desired result.

It could be likened to creating a sculpture, for example. At the start, all that exists is a relatively formless potential. The process of turning the blank canvas into a work of art is in this case done by chipping away everything that does not suit the end result. It is in this process, by removing everything that does not serve the needs of the desired state that the finished product is born.

This applies to computer programming in the same way. Any project starts out as a blank canvas that does absolutely nothing, and it isn't until we specify exactly what we want the system to do that it begins to come to life. In order to optimize it, even more constraints are put in place to minimize the chance of the system going rogue and breaking. Take TypeScript vs. JavaScript for example. The level of constraint continues to increase with the intention of minimizing unintended effects.

The same could be said about life and what it means to discipline yourself. Without any constraint on the human system, we would devolve into anarchy or maybe never even make it past the "Lord of the Flies" stage. Our society would break. But we do discipline ourselves, obviously some more than others, in an attempt to increase the likelihood of acheiving a desired outcome. By disciplining our mind and our actions we remove aspects of our psyche that could inhibit a successful outcome. By narrowing our focus and being as specific as possible, we improve the odds of acheiving a desired result, just like a computer program.
